# Creating 1 Player Dice Game

Challenge set was to recreate a CSS Zen Garden website by only making changes in the css using available html and a few images


# What I liked
* I'm a creative person so this task really appealed to me
* Enjoyed researching about css - how to for instance remove bullet point from a list item by searching google as this is the best way to learn
* Enjoyed just playing around and seeing what happens to the webpage


# What I didn't like
* Knowing for example that flex box was required for the footer section but not fully understanding how to implement it


# What need to work on
* Practising recreating other websites to get used to working with css
* working on when classes and id's are required
* practise froggyflexbox to up my flexbox skills


# next steps
* Finishing the challenge specifically the footer section which I struggled with
